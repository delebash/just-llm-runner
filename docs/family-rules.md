# Family rules

The rules every family repo follows: JustWrite, JustVoice, docgen and this kit. Each repo's
CLAUDE.md imports this file; a repo's own rules stay in its CLAUDE.md. How an app is laid out is
[`app-structure.md`](app-structure.md) §Q; the reference app is [`../template/`](../template/).

- **No hardcoded values a user might want to change.** Thresholds, limits, names and presets live
  in the database (seeded, editable in Settings), not in code, so changing one never needs a code
  change.
- **The server owns the data.** An app's data is one SQLite database that only its server reads
  and writes; the screen holds no durable data and asks the server. The desktop window, the
  browser tab of a headless server, the phone and other apps calling the API must all see the
  same data.
- **Nothing hand-rolled that Quasar or the kit ships.** The kit's `Ui*` controls sit on Quasar's
  components; apps use the `Ui*` API, and a shape the kit doesn't have uses Quasar's own component
  before anything hand-rolled. Before building a control, dialog, task or service, look in the kit
  (`ui/src/index.js`, `ui/src/common/index.js`, `server/`), in the app's own `src/services/`, and
  for a screen that already has the same shape, and reuse it. A gap is filled in the kit so every
  app gets it. Copies drift and share bugs.
- **Code copied from another project keeps its licence notice** and gets an entry in the repo's
  `NOTICE.md`. MIT, Apache and BSD licences all require it.
